Daniel Lovell - Lesson 2 Portfolio Notes

//Overall description of what I have have working on this week
We had some Google+ issues at first. I had a setting that was blocking people from trying to contact me. Somehow our team decided to
communicate with Google Chat about our first meeting instead of our team community, but because of my Google+ setting I wasn't notified.
Luckily someone responded to my post in our cummunity half way through the meeting and I was able to join.I have fixed my problems and
we are all on the same page now.
During our first meeting there was some confusion about the assigned topics. I chose to study Git. I didn't figure out that it wasn't a
topic until I had already researched it. We figured out our mistakes from our first meeting, and I believe that we have everything good
going forward.
